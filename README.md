# hjet-performance-calculator
An easy, Excel Hondajet HA-420 performance calculator for simulator use only.

# What is this for ?
This is aiming to be an easy, Excel spreadsheet to lookup and calculate accurate Hondajet HA-420 takeoff and landing speeds and weight limitations. This is for simulator use only and was created primarily for the Hondajet by FlightFX.

All data comes from the real Hondajet HA-420 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). There may be some discrepancies between limitations / ideal values for the aircraft in the simulator and in real life.

# What am I aiming to include in the first release?
V-speeds, Take off Field Length, and Maximum Takeoff Weight for various temperatures, airfield altitudes, icing conditions and takeoff flap settings.

# Landing data coming later?
Yes.

# How can I follow progress?
You can download the Excel spreadsheet and have a look or follow the project Trello board here: https://trello.com/b/ZCldm08g/hondajet-performance-calculator
Please bear in mind all the calculated fields and tables will be exposed in initial versions. The final version will include a rudimentary UI and will only display relevant input and final output fields.
